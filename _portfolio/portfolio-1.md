# Comparing the UK to Other European Countries

The European market saw a 15.9% increase in electric vehicle (EV) sales from 2020 to 2021. This growth was mainly driven by Germany, contributing to 24.8% of the number of EV sales in Europe in 2022. Since 2020, Germany has realised a noticeable increase in EV sales, propelled by stringent CO2 emission regulations and a gradual transition toward zero-emission vehicles.

The United Kingdom, despite being one of the first countries to embrace EVs back in 2010, has faced challenges in keeping up with the rapid growth seen in Germany and France. Factors such as inconsistent government policies, limited charging infrastructure, and fluctuating consumer incentives have hindered the UKâ€™s ability to become a leading country in the electric vehicle industry.
