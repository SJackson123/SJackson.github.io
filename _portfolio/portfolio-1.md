## What is the global market share of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles compared to battery electric vehicles?

* Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) have both an engine and electric motor to power the car. They differ from regular hybrid vehicles by having a much larger battery with about 10 to 40 miles before their combustion engines provide assistance <sup>[2]</sup>.

* Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are fully electric vehicles with rechargeable batteries and no combustion engine. 

From the figure below, we see that Europe has the largest share of PHEVs in the electric vehicle market providing drivers with reassurance against the anxiety associated with the limited range of BEVs.

On the other hand, China has the largest share of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) due to strategic investments in electric vehicle technology since the early 2000s. Recognising the challenges in competing with established car manufacturers, China incentivised electric vehicle development by offering subsidies to companies willing to take the risk. As a result, over the past two years, the number of electric vehicles produced in China has grown from 1.1 million to 6.4 million. For comparison, the EU only sold 1.8 million electric vehicles in 2022. This makes 2022 the eighth consecutive year in which China has the world’s largest market for electric vehicles.

We see a global increase in electric vehicles, and as we progress, this trend maintains an upward trajectory.

## Comparing the UK to Europe
The European market saw a 4.65% increase in electric vehicle (EV) production from 2021 to 2022. This growth was mainly driven by Germany, contributing to 29.4% of the number of EV produced in Europe in 2022.

Since 2020, Germany has noticeably increased EV production reaching a high of 690,000 vehicles produced in 2021. This is likely due to the stringent CO2 emission regulations and a gradual transition toward zero-emission vehicles.

The United Kingdom, despite being one of the first countries to embrace EVs back in 2010, has faced challenges in keeping up with the rapid growth seen in Germany and France. Factors such as inconsistent government policies, limited charging infrastructure, and fluctuating consumer incentives have hindered the UK’s ability to become a leading country in the electric vehicle industry <sup>[1]</sup>.
