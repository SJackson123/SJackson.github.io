&#9995; I am currently completing a Data Analyst Bootcamp at [Generation](https://uk.generation.org/programs/data-analytics-2/)

&#128202; Currently searching for a position as an entry level Data Analyst or anything to do with data

&#127884; I am teaching myself Japanese in my spare time

# Personal Bio

<p align="justify">
An experienced MSc Graduate in Computer Science and currently seeking a position as a Data Analyst. I enjoy drawing insights from data and connecting them to tell a story. This serves as motivation for building a career in Data Analytics. My combination of skills equips me for a wide range of positions. In my undergraduate I developed skills in Statistical Inference and modelling as well as studying Financial Mathematics. My Masters further equipped me with extensive quantitative knowledge and technical experience in Computer Science. I’ve focused my studies on Deep Reinforcement learning and in my dissertation I compared Deep Reinforcement Learning methods and Evolutionary Strategies in Tetris. This research deepened my knowledge of sequential decision making under uncertainty and I gained numerical programming skills in Python for data manipulation, cleaning and analysis. </p>

<p align="justify">My combination of skills, backed by a resourceful and dependable attitude, equips me for a wide range of positions. I have an MSc in Computer Science from the University of Bath and a BSC in Economics & Mathematics from the University of Sheffield.</p>

<p align="justify">On the Data Analyst bootcamp with Generation UK&I, I developed a true appreciation for growth mindset, continuous learning and networking. These are some of the most powerful skills to have in the tech industry, to which I believe I possess all three. Gaining industry relevant knowledge and skills has given me the platform to confidently analyse data using Excel, creating pivot tables and interactive dashboards to drill deeper into data. I used SQL Server Management Studio to extract and clean data from the AdventureWorks2019 public dataset. After extracting the data, I used Python along with Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib for visualisation and identifying relationships between variables. In the final project, I used Power BI to create a Feedback Report on reviews from the Olist company. Olist is an E-commerce company that connects small and micro businesses to retailers like Walmart for selling their products. I started with managing connections in the database and cleaning the data (formatting dates, cleaning empty rows). Afterwards, I performed exploratory analysis on ‘how ratings affect sales over time’ and ‘identifying which categories perform the best over the years’. </p>

<p align="justify">The bootcamp has sparked an interest in database management systems, and I enjoy learning concepts around database design. Beyond the bootcamp, I will expand my portfolio of projects focusing on optimising SQL queries, exploring advanced data cleaning topics such as joining tables without keys and developing skills in Power BI to create more detailed reports and dashboards. Looking ahead to my future role, I would like to identify things that don’t work and fix them and build skills on scoping dashboards. </p>
