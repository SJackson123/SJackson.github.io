# Personal Bio

<p align="justify">
Hello, I'm Sebastian Jackson and I am currently seeking a position as an Entry Level Data Analyst. I enjoy drawing insights from data and connecting them to tell a story. This blend of technical and creative aspects serves as motivation for building a career in Data Analytics.</p>

<p align="justify">My combination of skills, backed by a resourceful and dependable attitude, equips me for a wide range of positions. I have an MSc in Computer Science from the University of Bath and a BSC in Economics & Mathematics from the University of Sheffield.</p>

<p align="justify">I have a strong background in statistical and economic theory that allows me to effectively analyse data and connect data insights to business operations. In addition, I have the programming skills essential for data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.</p>

<p align="justify">Currently, I am completing the Generation Data Analyst bootcamp and gaining industry relevant skills:</p>

- Analysed data using Excel: Pivot tables, Power Query, dashboards
- Used SQL Server Management Studio to perform common table expression and window functions. This has sparked my interest in learning the fundamentals of database design
- Exploratory data analysis in Python: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- Using Power BI to create dashboards and reports
- Currently studying towards the Microsoft PL-900 exam which focuses on how Power Platform Applications can be used to solve business problems

<p align="justify">As I explored different areas throughout the bootcamp, I have developed three areas of interest: data processing and database design, cleaning data with SQL or Python, and visualising data with Power BI. I am eager to expand my skillset in any of these areas, recognising the potential they hold for shaping impactful data analysis.</p>
