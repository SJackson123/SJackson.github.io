# Personal Bio

<div style="text-align: justify;">Hello, I'm Sebastian Jackson and I am currently seeking a position as an Entry Level Data Analyst. I enjoy drawing insights from data and connecting them to tell a story. This blend of technical and creative aspects serves as motivation for building a career in Data Analytics.</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">My combination of skills, backed by a resourceful and dependable attitude, equips me for a wide range of positions. I have an MSc in Computer Science from the University of Bath and a BSC in Economics & Mathematics from the University of Sheffield.</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">I have a strong background in statistical and economic theory that allows me to effectively analyse data and connect data insights to business operations. Then to top it off, I have the programming skills essential for data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Currently, I am completing the Generation Data Analyst bootcamp and gaining industry relevant skills. I have analysed data using Excel, creating pivot tables and interactive dashboards to drill deeper into data. I learned to use SQL Server Management Studio with common table expressions and window functions. This has sparked an interest in database management systems, and I enjoy learning concepts around database design. I have previous experience in Python in Deep Reinforcement Learning, so I focused on learning the capabilities of Pandas and NumPy in more depth and applying these to my own datasets (all projects can be seen in the projects tab at the top of the page). The last portion of the course focuses on Power BI, which I have started to explore in my own time in preparation for the Microsoft PL-900 exam which focuses on how Power Platform Applications can be used to solve business problems.</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">With a blend of theoretical skills complemented by practical programming skills, I am passionate about continually expanding my knowledge and skills in data analytics.</div>
